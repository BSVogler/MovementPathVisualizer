# MovementPathVisualizer
Tool to visualize movement path+timestamp data using framework [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe).

While the file loading and replay works the line drawing currently does not work.

A sample data file is `2_trial0.replay`

To have file access start a webserver in the directory e.g. with 
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` or ```python3 -m http.server```
